        <strong>AI Career Assistant</strong>(AICA) is a job-matching platform
        that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented
        Generation (RAG). It seeks to close the gap between the skills of
        technology graduates and the requirements of today&apos;s job
        market. Through a structured resume process and AI-driven job matching,
        AICA helps graduating students and recent graduates present their skills
        more effectively and discover opportunities that match their strengths
        and aspirations. This research also addresses the shortcomings of
        conventional job portals by offering an intelligent, user-centered
        system that promotes more accurate and efficient job matching in the
        technology sector.
