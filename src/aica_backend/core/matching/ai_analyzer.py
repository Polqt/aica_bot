CANDIDATE'S SKILLS: {user_skills_text}
JOB REQUIREMENTS: {job_skills_text}
POSITION: {job_title} at {company}

MATCH BREAKDOWN:
‚Ä¢ Direct Matches: {matched_skills_text}
‚Ä¢ Related Skills: {partial_matches_text}
‚Ä¢ Missing Skills: {missing_skills_text}
‚Ä¢ Overall Match: {round(compatibility_score * 100, 1)}%

CRITICAL ANALYSIS RULES:
1. ACCURACY: Only match skills the candidate ACTUALLY has - no assumptions
2. HONESTY: Be transparent about gaps and mismatches
3. FAIRNESS: Consider related skills and transferable competencies
4. ACTIONABILITY: Provide specific, practical guidance for improvement

ANALYSIS STRUCTURE:

**SKILLS ALIGNMENT** (200-300 words)
Evaluate how the candidate's actual skills match the job requirements:

‚úì STRONG MATCHES: List specific skills that directly align
‚Ä¢ Explain WHY each match is valuable for this role
‚Ä¢ Note if skills are core vs. complementary

‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL MATCHES: Identify related but not exact skills
‚Ä¢ Example: Has "React" but needs "Vue.js" - related frontend frameworks
‚Ä¢ Explain transferability and learning curve

‚úó MISSING CRITICAL SKILLS: Be honest about gaps
‚Ä¢ List key requirements the candidate doesn't have
‚Ä¢ Prioritize by importance (must-have vs. nice-to-have)
‚Ä¢ Estimate learning effort for each gap

**MATCH ASSESSMENT** (100-150 words)
‚Ä¢ Overall compatibility score reasoning
‚Ä¢ Confidence level in the match (High/Medium/Low)
‚Ä¢ Role fit assessment (Excellent/Good/Fair/Poor)
‚Ä¢ Readiness level (Ready Now/Nearly Ready/Needs Development)

**SKILL GAP ANALYSIS** (150-200 words)
Break down missing skills into categories:
‚Ä¢ CRITICAL GAPS: Must-have skills completely missing
‚Ä¢ TRAINABLE GAPS: Skills that can be learned relatively quickly
‚Ä¢ ADVANCED GAPS: Complex skills requiring significant time investment

For each gap, provide:
‚Ä¢ Difficulty level (Easy/Moderate/Hard)
‚Ä¢ Typical learning timeline (days/weeks/months)
‚Ä¢ Recommended resources (online courses, books, practice projects)

**CAREER RECOMMENDATIONS** (150-200 words)
Provide actionable next steps:

IF HIGH MATCH (80%+):
‚Ä¢ Emphasize application worthiness
‚Ä¢ Suggest how to highlight relevant experience
‚Ä¢ Recommend interview preparation focus areas

IF MEDIUM MATCH (50-80%):
‚Ä¢ Identify quick wins to improve candidacy
‚Ä¢ Suggest alternative similar positions
‚Ä¢ Provide 30-60-90 day skill development plan

IF LOW MATCH (<50%):
‚Ä¢ Be honest about fit challenges
‚Ä¢ Suggest better-matched alternative roles
‚Ä¢ Provide comprehensive upskilling roadmap
‚Ä¢ Recommend intermediate stepping-stone positions

**STANDOUT STRENGTHS** (50-100 words)
Highlight candidate's unique value propositions:
‚Ä¢ Rare or highly valuable skills they possess
‚Ä¢ Combinations of skills that create unique expertise
‚Ä¢ Competitive advantages over typical candidates

**FINAL VERDICT** (50-100 words)
Summary recommendation:
‚Ä¢ Should they apply? (Strongly Yes/Yes/Maybe/Not Yet)
‚Ä¢ Expected interview success likelihood
‚Ä¢ Timeframe to become fully qualified (if not already)
‚Ä¢ One key action item to improve match

TONE & STYLE:
- Professional but encouraging
- Honest without being discouraging
- Specific and actionable
- Balanced (acknowledge both strengths and gaps)
- Use clear headings and bullet points
- Avoid jargon unless explaining it
- Target total length: 750-1000 words

Focus on being genuinely helpful for the candidate's career development."""
