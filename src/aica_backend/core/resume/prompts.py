‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES - READ CAREFULLY:

‚úÖ EXTRACT SKILLS FROM THESE SECTIONS ONLY:
1. **Skills Section**: Any section explicitly labeled as "Skills", "Technical Skills", "Core Competencies", "Technologies", "Tools & Technologies", "Proficiencies", "Expertise"
2. **Work Experience**: Skills mentioned where the candidate ACTIVELY USED them with action verbs:
   - "developed with Python", "implemented React application", "managed AWS infrastructure"
   - "utilized Java for...", "created using Node.js", "designed with Figma"
   - "maintained MySQL databases", "deployed Docker containers"
3. **Projects Section**: Technologies explicitly used in personal or professional projects
4. **Education**: ONLY if specific technical coursework is mentioned (e.g., "Completed coursework in Machine Learning, Data Structures")
5. **Qualifications Summary/Profile**: Skills mentioned in summary sections where candidate claims proficiency

‚ùå ABSOLUTELY DO NOT EXTRACT SKILLS FROM:
- **Certifications/Certificates**: NEVER extract skills just because they appear in certification names
  - Example: "AWS Certified Solutions Architect" ‚Üí DO NOT extract "AWS" from this alone
  - Example: "Java Programming Certificate" ‚Üí DO NOT extract "Java" from this alone
  - Example: "Google Cloud Professional Certificate" ‚Üí DO NOT extract "Google Cloud" from this alone
  - Only extract if the skill ALSO appears in work experience, projects, or skills section
- **Course Names/Training Titles**: Do NOT extract from course or training program names
- **Seminars/Workshops/Trainings**: Do NOT extract skills from seminar, workshop, or training attendance
  - Example: "Attended Python Programming Seminar" ‚Üí DO NOT extract "Python" from this alone
  - Example: "Workshop on Machine Learning" ‚Üí DO NOT extract "Machine Learning" from this alone
  - Example: "Training: Advanced JavaScript" ‚Üí DO NOT extract "JavaScript" from this alone
  - Only extract if the skill ALSO appears in work experience, projects, or skills section
- **Certificate Descriptions**: Do NOT extract from what the certificate covers
- **References Section**: Do NOT extract from reference information or reference names
- **Education Degree Names**: Do NOT extract from degree titles unless in explicit skills/coursework section
- **Implied/Inferred Skills**: Do NOT guess skills that aren't explicitly stated
- **Tools mentioned in passing**: Only extract if there's evidence of actual usage
- **Soft skills without evidence**: Do NOT extract soft skills unless clearly demonstrated in experience

‚ö†Ô∏è NAME EXTRACTION - CRITICAL WARNING:
- DO NOT extract people's NAMES as skills (e.g., "John Smith", "Mary Johnson")
- Names are typically 2-4 capitalized words and should NEVER be in the skills list
- If you see a proper name (capitalized first and last name), it's NOT a skill
- Double-check: Does this look like a person's name? If yes, exclude it

‚ö†Ô∏è VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT (MANDATORY):
For EACH skill you consider extracting, verify it meets ONE of these criteria:
‚úì Appears in a "Skills" or "Technical Skills" or "Core Competencies" section

‚úì Appears in a project description showing actual application  
‚úì Explicitly stated in summary/profile section as a claimed skill
‚úì Listed in education as specific completed coursework

STRICT QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Prefer ACCURACY and PRECISION over quantity
- Extract 8-25 technical skills for tech resumes (NOT 40+)
- Extract 5-10 soft skills (only if clearly demonstrated with examples)
- Every skill MUST be verifiable in resume text through actual usage or explicit listing

‚ñ° Does it appear in work experience with usage verbs (developed, built, created, managed, etc.)? OR  
‚ñ° Does it appear in a project with actual application? OR
‚ñ° Is it listed in education as completed coursework? OR
‚ñ° Is it explicitly stated in profile/summary as a claimed skill?
‚ñ° Is it definitely NOT a person's name?

STRICT 4-STEP EXTRACTION PROCESS:

STEP 1 - IDENTIFY SECTIONS TO EXCLUDE:
- Locate Certifications/Certificates section ‚Üí IGNORE THIS ENTIRELY for skill extraction
- Locate Training/Courses section ‚Üí IGNORE THIS ENTIRELY for skill extraction
- Locate Seminars/Workshops section ‚Üí IGNORE THIS ENTIRELY for skill extraction

- Education Coursework ‚Üí Extract ONLY if specific courses are listed (e.g., "Coursework: Machine Learning, Data Structures")
- Summary/Profile ‚Üí Extract skills if explicitly claimed with confidence

STEP 3 - FILTER OUT NAMES (CRITICAL):
- Review your extracted list
- Remove ANY item that looks like a person's name (2-4 capitalized words, especially from References)
- Examples to remove: "John Doe", "Dr. Smith", "Professor Garcia", "Mary Johnson"

- Remove any skill that only appears in certification/degree names
- Remove any skill without verification from Step 2
- Ensure no people's names made it through

FINAL QUALITY CHECK:
- Technical skills: 8-25 items (focused, not exhaustive)
- Soft skills: 5-10 items (only if demonstrated with examples)
- NO people's names in the list
- Every skill verifiable in resume text
- Zero skills extracted solely from certifications or degree names

Return a focused, accurate list of skills with EVIDENCE of actual use or explicit listing, and NO people's names.
